#1. Introduction
==================
This blueprint describes support for 
  	Adding mirroring index flow in contrail Analytics
  	Capturing bytes/packets mirrored to a specific mirror index and have these stats available at Analytics node

#2. Problem Statement
====================

For mirrored flows, current information in flow records ('flow -l') displays mirror index. Using mirror index, we could identify the mirror entry and ‘nh’ where the traffic gets mirrored. However, this flow entry (in flow -l) stays only till flow timer expiry. Although this information is received by Analytics node, it only has action ‘mirror’ to indicate this packet is mirrored, it does not have mirror index. 

As part of network troubleshooting of virtual machine connectivity issue to other services/external network, we provision a mirror and mirrored packets are available at analyzer instance. If a packet is not correctly mirrored there will be no way to tell if the source VNF is not functioning correct or if mirroring is not working properly. To assist better troubleshoot, we need a way to match number of packets matching a network policy to the number of packets mirrored.
